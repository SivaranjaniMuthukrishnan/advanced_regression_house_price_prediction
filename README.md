# US-based housing dataset: Advanced Regression
> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip > them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.
> The data is provided in the CSV file (train.csv). The company wants to know:

> 1. Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
> 2. How well those variables describe the price of a house.

### Business Goal
Create a ridge and lasso model to identify the predictors which describes the price of a house well.
Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.
